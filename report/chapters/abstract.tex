Smart 21 aims to develop an intelligent system composed of agents that are capable of playing 21. The objective is to create different agents with different levels of intelligence to exploit the famouse game, cheating like counting the cards is not forbideen here but encouraged. Table will be attended always by a single agent that plays against a dealer and has a precise amount of funds to raise or to loose. Deck will be the classical 52 cards in two colors so 104 cards and when all the cards are used another deck will be used so the game could go on.

% \noindent\textbf{Guidance on abstract writing:} An abstract is a summary of a report in a single paragraph up to a maximum of 250 words. An abstract should be self-contained, and it should not refer to sections, figures, tables, equations, or references. An abstract typically consists of sentences describing the following four parts: (1) introduction (background and purpose of the project), (2) methods, (3) results and analysis, and (4) conclusions. The distribution of these four parts of the abstract should reflect the relative proportion of these parts in the report itself. An abstract starts with a few sentences describing the project's general field, comprehensive background and context, the main purpose of the project; and the problem statement. A few sentences describe the methods, experiments, and implementation of the project. A few sentences describe the main results achieved and their significance. The final part of the abstract describes the conclusions and the implications of the results to the relevant field.
